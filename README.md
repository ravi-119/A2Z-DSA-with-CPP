# A2Z DSA with C++

This repository contains various C++ programs and algorithms to help you understand the basics of C++ programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA). The repository is organized into different folders, each focusing on a specific topic.

## Folder Structure

### Basics of C++ Programming

This folder contains basic C++ programs to help you get started with C++ programming.

- `decision.cpp`: Demonstrates the use of if, else if, and switch statements.
- `function.cpp`: Shows how to define and use functions, including call by value and call by reference.
- `hello.cpp`: A simple "Hello World" program.
- `input_output.cpp`: Demonstrates basic input and output operations.
- `loop.cpp`: Shows the use of while, for, and do-while loops.
- `size.cpp`: Displays the size of various data types in C++.

### GFG Problems

This folder contains solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks.

- `data_type.cpp`: A function to return the size of a given data type.
- `decision_making_in_cpp.cpp`: A function to compare two integers and return their relation.

### Patterns

This folder contains programs to print various patterns.

- `pattern.cpp`: Contains multiple functions to print different patterns.
- `pattern1.cpp`: Prints a diamond pattern based on an odd number input.

### Sorting Techniques

This folder contains implementations of different sorting algorithms.

- `bubble_sort.cpp`: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
- `insertion_sort.cpp`: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
